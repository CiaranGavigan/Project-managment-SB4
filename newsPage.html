    <p>CEO Pat Gelsinger offers a more confident assessment after the chipmaker struggled for years to sustain processor progress.</p>
    <p>After years of struggling to keep up with competitors, Intel will adopt their core strategy by making other 
	companies' chips for them, new Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said Tuesday. Intel largely has focused on making 
	its own chips, but that'll change with the new and independent Intel Foundry Services business unit.

	If the shift works, it'll mark a major turnaround for a decades-old Silicon Valley powerhouse. For years, technology 
	leadership and the "Intel Inside" marketing campaign kept the chipmaker at the forefront of personal technology. But 
	in recent years, Intel failed to tap into the mobile market and has suffered several delays to PC processor progress.

    <p>Slack, which offers instant-messaging within companies, now lets you exchanges messages with people outside your
	company. Slack Connect DMs, announced in October, are designed to work with partner companies or clients.

	Paid users will be able to use the new feature starting Wednesday, and you'll need an email address for the person 
	you're connecting with. To send a Connect DM, you create a new message and should see a "DM outside your company" 
	option in the top right of the screen. Once you click that, you can enter the person's email address. </p>
    <p>"Once your partner accepts the emailed invitation, they'll automatically appear in your list of direct message
	recipients and you'll be able to message them in Slack," the company said. "This includes any current user of Slack, 
	even those on the free plan."

	Slack is also planning to expand this feature so that several companies will be able to link together to create a 
	private business network with unified directories, channel discovery and other features.</p>

	<p>One Plus has always been one of the top options for people looking for the top of the line android flagship with all the best specs 
	like loads of ram the fasted mobile processor and the best camera but that last category has been what usually holds one plus back but not this year</p>
	<p>This year one plus has teamed up with Hasselblad the company that made the original cameras for the appolo mission that made it to the moon and they have been making 
	cameras ever since so they know how to make a good camera lens the reviews of the new one plus are as we expected and the new camera is one of the best on the android 
	market and even trades blows with apples camera on the iphone 12</p>

    <img src= "chipShortage.jpeg" alt= "micron and tmc in red alert due to drought" style="height:400px; width:100%;">
    <p>The on going gpu crisis could be getting a lot worse as the two main makers of high grade silicon in the worlds two main fabs are in red alert due to the current drought
      affecting taiwan and the fabs are set to be limited to five days a week of operation instead of seven to conserve water </p>
      <p>The effect this will have on the current crisis we find ourselves in will mean that you probably wont be able to get your hands on a shiny new graphics card anytime soon
      and this will probably severly impact other sectors like automotive and phone manufacturing soon too only the future will tell if we ever manage to get out of gpu hell</p>

    <h2 style="color: red">Game Stop is now selling Pc parts </h2>
    <img src= "gamestop.jpg" alt= "GameStop Selling Pc parts " style="height:400px; width:100%;">
    <p>In the last few days it has become news that GameStop is now going to sell pc components for the first time in its history. GameStop has become a sort of relic of the past 
      like blockbuster of the gaming world hanging onto life but in a bid to stay relevent in a nearly all digital world selling pc parts actually could make sense for the company as 
      the number of people buying and building pc's is dramatically on the rise due to covid keeping people indoors and working from home so trying to get these parts is very tricky right now
      so by selling the parts in brick and mortar stores more people might be able to get their hands on parts as most people can get to a Game Stop as they have stores in many countries and many regions

    <h2 style="color: blue">Microsoft Buying Discord </h2>
    <img src= "discord.jpg" alt= "Discord being bought " style="height:400px; width:100%;">
    <p> latest news in software is that the very popular communication platform for PC Discord is being aquired by the tech giant Microsoft for a cool 10 Billion now nothing is confirmed yet but 
      the rumors are fairly solid and as Microsoft are focusing on their crossplatform with xbox and pc it might make sense that they use discord as their main form of communication so that pc players 
      and xbox players are able to play and talk seemlessly according to sources there was a number of other parties interested in discord epic games and amazon were said to be in the ring too.
